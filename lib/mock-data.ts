We observed correlations that support the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n## Introduction\nQuantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others.\n\n## Methodology\nWe used a parametric down-conversion crystal to generate entangled photon pairs and measured their polarization states using polarizers and single-photon detectors.\n\n## Results\nOur measurements showed a violation of Bell's inequality with a statistical significance of 5 sigma, confirming the presence of quantum entanglement.\n\n## Discussion\nThe results support the non-local nature of quantum mechanics and demonstrate that quantum entanglement cannot be explained by classical physics.",
